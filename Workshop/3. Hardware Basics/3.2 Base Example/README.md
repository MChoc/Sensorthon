# Base example

The following outlines how to connect the DHT11 to the Edukit M5 Stack Core 2 device.

1. Grab the Edukit device and make sure the top and bottom parts are secured to each other (the 4 screws should be fastened to the device)
2. Grab the grove connector cable and connect the connector's female port into PORT B of the Edukit device. Port B is the top left port when looking at the Edukit device from top down or front on. This port is also labelled with a "Port B" label. A correct connection can be shown as the black cable being the left most colour on the grove connector.
