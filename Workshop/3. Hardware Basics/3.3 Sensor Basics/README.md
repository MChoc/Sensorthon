# Sensor Basics

***

The following outlines a brief summary of the various sensor types each participating team will be provided within the base kit.

Further sensor recommendations not included in the base kit will be shown in a list at the end of this file, however these devices may be considered out of support scope, so please keep that in mind when considering usage of the suggested sensors.
